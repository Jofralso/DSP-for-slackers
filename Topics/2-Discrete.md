## Topic 2: Discrete-Time Signals and Systems

In this topic, we'll dive into discrete-time signals and systems, a foundational aspect of Digital Signal Processing. Understanding these concepts is essential for analyzing and processing signals in a digital domain.

**Explanation:**

1. **Discrete-Time Signals:**
   Discrete-time signals are sequences of values defined at discrete time instances. Each value corresponds to a specific time index. Common types include step, impulse, sinusoidal, and more complex sequences. Discrete-time signals are essential as they model real-world signals in a format suitable for digital processing.

2. **Properties of Discrete-Time Signals:**
   - **Periodicity:** Some discrete-time signals repeat after a certain number of samples.
   - **Causality:** A signal is causal if the current value depends only on past and present values, not future ones.
   - **Stability:** A system is stable if its output remains bounded for bounded input.

3. **Discrete-Time Systems:**
   A discrete-time system takes an input signal and produces an output signal. Systems can be linear or nonlinear, time-invariant or time-variant. Key properties include linearity, causality, stability, and memory.

Understanding discrete-time signals and systems is fundamental for analyzing, processing, and designing DSP algorithms. These concepts serve as the building blocks for further exploration into DSP applications.
