## Topic 4: Z-Transform and Transfer Functions

In this topic, we'll explore the Z-transform and transfer functions, fundamental tools in digital signal processing used for system analysis and design.

**Explanation:**

1. **Z-Transform:**
   - The Z-transform is a powerful tool to analyze discrete-time systems in the frequency domain. It's an extension of the Fourier Transform from continuous to discrete-time signals.
   - The Z-transform of a sequence provides a way to represent the sequence in terms of complex exponentials.

2. **Transfer Functions:**
   - Transfer functions relate the output of a system to its input in the frequency domain. For a discrete-time LTI system, the transfer function is the Z-transform of the system's impulse response.
   - Understanding transfer functions is crucial for analyzing system stability and behavior.

Understanding the Z-transform and transfer functions is essential for designing filters, analyzing system stability, and understanding the behavior of discrete-time systems.
