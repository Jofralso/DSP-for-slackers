## Topic 3: Time-Domain and Frequency-Domain Analysis

In this topic, we'll explore the analysis of signals in both the time domain and the frequency domain. This dual perspective is crucial for understanding how signals behave and how they can be processed.

**Explanation:**

1. **Time-Domain Analysis:**
   - **Convolution:** Convolution is a mathematical operation that describes the output of a linear time-invariant system to an input signal. It's fundamental in understanding how systems respond to different inputs.
   - **Difference Equations:** These describe the relationship between the input, output, and the internal state of a discrete-time system.

2. **Frequency-Domain Analysis:**
   - **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT):** It transforms a discrete signal from the time domain to the frequency domain, allowing us to analyze the signal's frequency components.
   - **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):** It's an efficient algorithm to compute the DFT. Understanding FFT is crucial for real-time processing and analysis of signals.

Understanding both time and frequency domains is essential as they provide different insights into a signal. Time-domain analysis helps understand how a signal evolves over time, while frequency-domain analysis reveals its frequency components.
