## Topic 5: Filter Design

In this topic, we'll focus on the design of digital filters, a central aspect of digital signal processing. Filters are crucial for manipulating and enhancing signals in various applications.

**Explanation:**

1. **Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filters:**
   - FIR filters are characterized by a finite impulse response, making them easy to implement and design.
   - Designing FIR filters involves selecting appropriate filter coefficients to achieve the desired frequency response.

2. **Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Filters:**
   - IIR filters have an infinite impulse response and can achieve a desired frequency response with fewer parameters compared to FIR filters.
   - Designing IIR filters involves finding the filter coefficients that meet the specified design criteria.

Understanding FIR and IIR filters and their design methods is fundamental for implementing various digital signal processing applications, including audio and image processing.
