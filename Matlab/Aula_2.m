% Answers: 
% a. If each of the systems is causal, then the ROC is the exterior of the
% circle defined by the largest pole. Also, the ROC that corresponds to a
% stable system must include the unit circle. This means that only H1 and
% H4 are stable.
% 
% b. If we assume that all the impulse responses are left-sided sequences,
% then the ROC is defined by the interior of the circle defined by the
% smallest pole. Again, the unit circle |z|=1 must be included in the ROC
% to have a stable system. In such a case none of the (here noncausal) 
% systems is stable.
%
% c. If every impulse response is a two-sided sequence, this means that the
% ROC is an annular ring defined in the region between: the circle with radius 
% equal to the magnitude of the farthest (from the origin) pole and the circle with
% radius equal to the magnitude of the nearest (to the origin) pole. In addition,
% in order the system to be stable, this annular ring must contain the unit
% circle. Therefore, if such is the case, H2 and H3 are stable.
