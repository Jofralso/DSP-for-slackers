'''Sampling theorem:

fsâ‰¥2fm

A continuous time signal can be represented as samples and can be recovered back when sampling frequency fs is greater than or equal to twice the highest frequency component of message signal.
If this condition does not satisfy, it leads to aliasing.
Aliasing is an effect   that causes different signals to become indistinguishable when sampled.
Visualizing using python:'''

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #  to plot
import numpy as np

#numerical python to get array of float values and for sine operation
t = np.arange(0, 2e-3, 10e-6) # x axis time period
\
# sampling at fs =10kHz in time domain ts=1/fs (0.1ms)
ts = np.arange(0,2e-3,0.1e-3)

f = 1000 # message signal fm
b = np.sin(2*np.pi*f*t) #phase for sinewave
c = np.sin(2*np.pi*f*ts)
plt.plot(t,b,"g") # plot of message signal (1kHz)
plt.plot(ts,c,"k*") # plot of sampled message signal (1kHz)
